# Web-Design-Challenge

This was a fun project and working on it helped me to realize what goes into creating html on your own.

In order to do the tasks I first created the index.html page. I used this page as a template for most of the others. The navigation bar was found on bootstrap.
Once I set up the index.html page, I worked on creating the rest of the pages. I created the data.html page after I created the other pages. In order to create the data page, I created a dataframe in Pandas and exported the dataframe to html. I then copied that information into the data.html page.
One of the most challenging things about working on the project was the time it toook to find the correct spacing, sizing, etc to make the images do what I wanted them to do. I explored with some colors and some other images to see how that could make my page a little more unique.
